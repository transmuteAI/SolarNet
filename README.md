Topology Optimization has been a very popular method for optimizing physical structures. Thismethod has also been extended to the domains of Heat Flow and Solar Cell design problems. But, theperformance is dependent on proper selection of parameters to be optimized. Better designs with betterperformance have been obtained with the use of Deep Learning in structural optimization. Metalliza-tion designs for Solar Cells obtained by topology optimization tend to give good efficiency. However,very limited use of deep learning has been made in optimizing Solar Cell metallization patterns. Inthis paper, we present the use of Convolutional Neural Networks without any training data to obtainmore robust and efficient designs
